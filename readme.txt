Stratus Forms for SharePoint Basic Usage:

1) Create a list to store form data
2) Create a field in this list with the name StratusFormsData.  This field *MUST* be a PLAIN TEXT MULTILINE FIELD
3) Create an HTML file for your form with the correspondging JavaScript and CSS as needed (see examples for... well... examples)
4) Upload this file somewhere that can be referenced in SharePoint (I typically use the Site Assets Document Library)
5) Create a page in SharePoint
6) Add a Content Editor Web Part to the page
7) Link the Content Editor Web Part to your form created in step 3
8) Ta Da!
